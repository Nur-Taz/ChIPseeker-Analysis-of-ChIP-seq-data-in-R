# ChIPseeker-Analysis-of-ChIP-seq-data-in-R

ChIPseeker is a very useful R package for carrying out detailed analyses on Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- sequencing data that lists the genomic intervals or "peaks" for a transcription factor binding to the genome. This hands-on session will have two parts:

### First 30-minute-session:

Get used to reading and understanding documentation (manual) for R packages . 
Learn how to create objects and variables in R . 
Learn scripting syntax (conventions) used in the ChIPseeker package

### Second 2-hour session:

Summarize & visualize important information about the peaks . 
Annotate the peaks with gene ID as well as genomic location . 
Carry out functional enrichment analysis on the peaks .
